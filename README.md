### CRUD: Create, Read, Update & Delete

In this [Stadium](https://stadium.software/) sample, we show you how to display data in a DataGrid. Additionally, we illustrate how to manipulate the data by creating, updating and deleting records in it. To do this, we used a real world example together with SQL Server and the Northwind database.

#### Sample Highlights:

- Connecting to a Database
- Executing a SQL query
- Reading records
- Creating records
- Editing records
- Deleting records
---
#### Configuring the Sample application:

1. Download the Northwind database [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and restore it.
2. Open the DataGridAddEdit application with the Stadium Designer.
3. Expand Connectors in the Application Explorer panel.
4. Update the NorthwindDatabaseConnector Connection String in the Properties panel according to your environment setup.
5.  Click on “Run” on the Ribbon in the Stadium Designer. This will deploy the solution to localhost and open it in your browser.
